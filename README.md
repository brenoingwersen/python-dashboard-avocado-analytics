Interactive dashboard using Python.

In this project I used the dash library to build an interactive dashboard using Python. The dash library is great for building analytical web applications without requiring advanced web development knowledge. I still needed to style the HTML components using CSS and also have a basic knowledge of the configuration of the elements of a basic webpage.

The dashbord contains the avocado data which can be found <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/neuromusic/avocado-prices">here</a>.
